Landing page based on a Figma project. Main issue was to slice design to a website and make it
fully responsive.
To this project I used gulp toolkit. Also, I did search a little for a slider and I have decided to
try with Glide.js.
Classes names in my css code were based on BEM approach.

Have fun looking at my project!
