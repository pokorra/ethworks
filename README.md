# ethworks
This is a task from Ethworks company. Main issue was to slice design to a website and make it
fully responsive.
To this project I used gulp toolkit. Also, I did search a little for a slider and I have decided to
try with glide.js (actually, the effect is not as good as I hoped for, but even if it isn't, I'm glad
that I used a new tool).
Classes names in my css code were based on BEM approach. I worked once with ABEM approach, so BEM was both
familiar and strange for me.

Have fun looking at my project!
